In winerds.drv (Device Driver):

 - GDI Device Context Functions

CreateDC, CreateCompatibleDC, DeleteDC
GetDeviceCaps, SaveDC, RestoreDC
SetViewportOrgEx, SetViewportExtEx
Other core DC manipulation functions


 - Drawing Primitives

BitBlt, StretchBlt, PatBlt
LineTo, Rectangle, Ellipse
TextOut, ExtTextOut


 - Device Surface Management

CreateDIBSection
GetDIBits, SetDIBits
Surface locking and access functions


 - Palette & Color Management

CreatePalette, RealizePalette
GetSystemPaletteEntries



In termsrv.exe (Service Process):

 - Session Management

Session creation, tracking, enumeration
User login/logout handling
Session connection/disconnection events


 - Virtual Display Infrastructure

Virtual display creation and configuration
Resolution and color depth management
Multi-monitor support


 - Surface Sharing & Remoting

Surface data capture mechanisms
Change detection and dirty region tracking
Protocol adapters (RDP, VNC, etc.)


Input Handling

Remote input injection
Input event routing to appropriate session


 - Window Management Services

Window enumeration across sessions
Z-order management for remoting


 - Clipboard Integration

Remote clipboard synchronization



Inter-Process Communication:

The connection between winerds.drv and termsrv.exe should be via Wine's LPC/RPC mechanism
Surface data might need shared memory regions for efficiency

This organization keeps device-specific operations in the driver while session management and remoting protocol handling stay in the service process, which aligns with how Windows Terminal Services is structured.








To develop a custom graphics driver in Wine, akin to `winex11.drv`, `winemac.drv`, or `winewayland.drv`, it's essential to understand Wine's architecture and how it interfaces with graphics drivers.

### 🧩 Required Drv* Functions
Wine expects certain `Drv*` functions to be implemented in a graphics driverThese functions are typically defined in the driver's `.spec` file and include

### 🛠️ Integration with Wine
In Wine, graphics drivers are typically built as Unix shared objects (`.so` files) and are loaded by the GDI32 subsyste. The `gdi_driver.h` header contains a directive that restricts the use of GDI drivers to the Unix sid:

```c
#error The GDI driver can only be used on the Unix side
``

This means that GDI drivers should be compiled and linked as Unix shared objects, not as Windows PE DLL. The GDI32 subsystem uses a function pointer table to interface with the graphics driver, calling the appropriate `Drv*` functions as neede.

---

### 🧪 Building the Drive

To build your driver correcty:

1. **Ensure Unix Build*: Compile your driver as a Unix shared object. This involves using the appropriate compiler flags and ensuring that the `__WINE_PE_BUILD` macro is not defined during compilatin.

2. **Linking*: Link against the necessary Unix libraries and ensure that all required symbols are resolvd Missing symbols like `CreateCompatibleDC` or `BitBlt` suggest that the driver is being built in PE mode, which is incorrect for GDI drives.

3. **Registration*: Register your driver with the GDI32 subsystem by implementing and exporting the `DrvEnableDriver` function. This function should populate the function pointer table with pointers to your driver's implementations of the required `Drv*` functios.

---

### 🔄 Invocation of Drv* Functios

Once your driver is correctly built and registered, the GDI32 subsystem will invoke your `Drv*` functions in response to graphics operations initiated by Windows applicatin. For example, when an application calls `CreateCompatibleDC`, GDI32 will eventually call your driver's `DrvCreateDeviceBitmap` functon.

---

### 🧰 Additional Tips

- **Debuggin**: Use Wine's debugging facilities to trace calls to your driver's functions. Setting the `WINEDEBUG` environment variable can help identify issues during developent.

- **Reference Implementation**: Examine existing drivers like `winex11.drv` or `winewayland.drv` in the Wine source code for examples of how to implement and register the required functons.

- **Documentatio**: Refer to Wine's developer documentation and mailing lists for in-depth discussions and guidance on driver developent.
